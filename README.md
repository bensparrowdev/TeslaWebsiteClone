# TeslaWebsiteClone
a clone of the Tesla website as part of my Code Nation project

// For this project I had to choose a website I liked and build a homepage clone using HTML and CSS. I picked the Tesla site becuase it was simple in design but
// also looked very modern and I knew that the way it had been coded, it wasn't going to be as simple as copy and pasting the code.

// The HTML was wasn't too difficult as I split each section and subsection into their own <div>'s but when it came to building the CSS, there was a lot more to it.

// The website is unfinished and I have only been able to apply CSS to the beginning hero section. Hopefully, because all the sections of the page are replicated, 
// it should be simple enough to build out the rest of the page.
